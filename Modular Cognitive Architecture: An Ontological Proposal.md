# Modular Cognitive Architecture: An Ontological Proposal


## Abstract

This document proposes an ontology for a Modular Cognitive Architecture (MCA), an engineering framework aimed at designing, orchestrating, and analyzing emergent cognitive systems. Unlike existing approaches such as neural architectures based on Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) or latent space steering techniques (e.g., steering vectors), our proposal does not position itself as an alternative but rather as a higher-level orchestration framework. We treat intelligence as a field of semantic interactions where specialized modules dynamically interact. We present here a formal ontology for this mental space, establish clear mathematical bridges with standard Machine Learning concepts for rigor, define internal dynamics mechanisms, and outline a pathway toward empirical validation. This work aims to lay conceptual and technical foundations for more intentional and interpretable engineering of complex cognitive systems.

**Keywords:** cognitive architecture, ontology, modular intelligence, latent space engineering, semantic propagation, emergent cognition, complex systems, metrics validation.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Context: Building Blocks of Modular Intelligence

The landscape of artificial intelligence has witnessed the emergence of several powerful yet often isolated advances: massive neural architectures (Transformers), efficient modularity (Mixture-of-Experts, MoE), latent space control (steering vectors), and neuro-symbolic systems. These approaches provide extraordinarily effective low-level mechanisms for routing, filtering, and weighting information.

### 1.2 Conceptual Breakthrough: From Mechanics to Orchestration

A legitimate question arises: how does MCA differ from these existing mechanisms? The breakthrough does not lie in inventing new low-level components, but rather in the level of abstraction and intentionality within the framework.

* **Existing mechanisms (Attention, Gates, MoE)** are the "transistors": They answer the question: "How can a signal be efficiently transmitted from A to B?"
* **MCA is the "operating system"**: It does not reinvent the transistor. It provides an ontology and language to intentionally assemble these mechanisms. It answers the question: "Why is it relevant to connect A to B, and what is the meaning of this connection?"

MCA shifts engineering from the computational level (adjusting matrix weights) to the cognitive level (defining relationships between modules labeled Frictional or Protective).

### 1.3 Proposal: An Ontology for Cognitive Engineering

We propose MCA not as a disruptive "discipline," but as an ontology and an engineering framework. Its goal is not to replace MoE or steering but to provide the structure and language to orchestrate them.

## 2. Ontology of the Mental Space (ùïÄ)

At the heart of our framework is the Internal Mental Space (ùïÄ), a weighted, directed dynamic graph.

### 2.1 Fundamental Components

| Component          | Notation    | Definition                       | ML Analogy          |
| ------------------ | ----------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| Mental Node        | N·µ¢ ‚àà ùïÄ     | Discrete cognitive unit          | An "expert" in MoE  |
| Mental Link        | L·µ¢‚±º : N·µ¢‚ÜíN‚±º | Potential transition             | Synaptic connection |
| Vibrational Weight | w(L·µ¢‚±º)      | Intensity/cost of the transition | Model weights (Œ∏)   |

### 2.2 Cognitive Primitives (Node Types)

Each node has a type categorizing its transfer function: Amplifier (A), Modulator (M), Protector (P), Germinator (G), Frictional (X), Reflector (R).

### 2.3 Operational Definitions of Key Concepts

* **"Semantic":** Topological signature of the node (weight vector).
* **Distinction of modules:** Verifiable through controlled perturbations.
* **"Emergence":** Measurable via the Emergence Amplification Factor (EAF).

## 3. Dynamics and Mathematical Anchoring

The system state evolves via semantic propagation, governed by meta-parameters (œÅ, Œ¥·µ£, œÑùëê, Œ∫), isomorphic to standard ML concepts.

| MCA Concept             | MCA Symbol | ML Concept     | ML Symbol |
| ----------------------- | ---------- | -------------- | --------- |
| Vibrational Weight      | w(L·µ¢‚±º)     | Model weights  | Œ∏         |
| Orbit Cost              | A(O)       | Loss Function  | L(y,≈∑)    |
| Mutation Rate           | Œ∑·µ•·µ¢·µ¶       | Learning Rate  | Œ∑         |
| Orbital Coherence Force | Œª‚Çí·µ£·µ¶·µ¢‚Çú‚Çê‚Çó   | Regularization | Œª         |

## 4. Engineering and Emergent Control

The Free Bloom Function Œ¶(t) serves as an external objective to optimize the emergent quality of the system.

## 5. Proposal for Validation and Measurement Protocol

### 5.1 Proposed Internal Metrics

| Monitored Property             | Symbol | Simplified Formula                         |
| ------------------------------ | ------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| Average Orbit Cost             | ƒÄ      | 1/N Œ£A(O‚Çñ)                                 |
| Semantic Coherence Index       | SCI    | 1 - (œÉ(d‚Çõ)/Œº(d‚Çõ))                          |
| Modular Independence Ratio     | MIR    | intra-correlation / inter-correlation      |
| Emergence Amplification Factor | EAF    | complexity(system) / Œ£ complexity(module·µ¢) |

### 5.2 Empirical Validation Protocol for Metrics

Define an external task, perform blind optimization, measure, and empirically validate the internal metrics.

## 6. Conclusion

MCA provides a structured framework to orchestrate neural mechanisms with enhanced conceptual and technical rigor, facilitating intentional and verifiable cognitive engineering.
